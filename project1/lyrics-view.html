            When the monsters are sleeping under your bed<br>
            They've crawled out from under and into your head<br>
            And outside the carcass, into your skin<br>
            And you need someone to keep it like it's said<br>
            <br>
            Your wishes into the air<br>
            So someone listens, someone is there<br>
            And you won't know anything about it<br>
            Until you have to live without it<br>
            <br>
            Chasing the fire for you<br>
            Light in the nightmare<br>
            Watching from high above you<br>
            <br>
            If you can make it then the sun will rise<br>
            It doesn't matter if you closed your eyes<br>
            Before you wake up, I'll keep you safe tonight<br>
            'Cause I am a warrior<br>
            And I'll fight, I'll fight, I'll fight, I'll fight<br>
            <br>
            The wheels are moving behind your face<br>
            Your arms are directing the time and the place<br>
            And you only have to do the travelling<br>
            You don't have to design the engine<br>
            <br>
            Doing the fighting for you<br>
            Breaking the walls down<br>
            Finding the right way, baby<br>
            <br>
            If you can make it then the sun will rise<br>
            It doesn't matter if you closed your eyes<br>
            Before you wake up, I'll keep you safe tonight<br>
            'Cause I am a warrior<br>
            And I'll fight, I'll fight, I'll fight, I'll fight<br>
            <br>
            If you wake up in darkness before the dawn breaks<br>
            There is a strength inside in this magic and mistakes<br>
            <br>
            Chasing the fire for you<br>
            Light in the nightmare<br>
            Watching from high above you<br>
            <br>
            If you can make it then the sun will rise<br>
            It doesn't matter if you close your eyes<br>
            Before you wake up, I'll keep you safe tonight<br>
            'Cause I am a warrior<br>
            And I'll fight, I'll fight, I'll fight<br>  
            <br>
            If you can make it then the sun will rise<br>
            It doesn't matter if you closed your eyes<br>
            Before you wake up, I'll keep you safe tonight<br>
            'Cause I am a warrior<br>
            And I'll fight, I'll fight, I'll fight, I'll fight</div>
